## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS basic properties

### What I learned

Practise implementing basic **CSS** properties such as height, width, display, position etc.

### Continued development

My goal is to learn about CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid and TailwindCSS and how to use in for future projects âœ¨. 

### Useful resources

- [Reference Solution from Front-End Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gAR-xtKK_E) - I was stuck in fixing my container to the center of the page with perfect fit so I took a reference from the solution. It turned out to be very beneficial for me and cleared more of my basic concepts ðŸ˜€.**I haven't copied the whole code, just took some reference**.
